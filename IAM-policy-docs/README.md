## IAM policy
Let's break down the different components of this JSON document:

- Version: Specifies the policy language version. In this case, it's set to "2012-10-17", which is the current version.
- Statement: Contains an array of policy statements. In this example, there's only one statement.
- Sid: Provides a unique identifier for the statement. It can be used for reference or to manage multiple statements.
- Effect: Specifies the effect of the policy, whether it's to "Allow" or "Deny" access.
- Principal: Defines the entity or entities to which the policy applies. In this case, the wildcard (*) denotes all entities.
- Action: Specifies the actions allowed or denied by the policy. In this example, it allows the "execute-api:Invoke" action.
- Resource: Defines the AWS resource to which the policy applies. The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) specifies the Amazon API Gateway endpoint "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123456789012:abcdefghij/*/GET/myEndpoint", where us-east-1 represents the AWS region, 123456789012 is the AWS account ID, abcdefghij is the API Gateway ID, * denotes any stage, and GET/myEndpoint represents the HTTP method and path.


Note that this is a simplified example, and depending on your specific use case and requirements, the policy may have additional statements or conditions.
