Using EC2 Roles and Instance Profiles
Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provide the ability to grant instances temporary credentials. These temporary credentials can then be used by hosted applications to access permissions configured within the role. IAM roles eliminate the need for managing credentials, help mitigate long-term security risks, and simplify permissions management. Prerequisites for this lab include understanding how to log in to and use the AWS Management Console, EC2 basics (including how to launch an instance), IAM basics (including users, policies, and roles), and how to use the AWS CLI.

Note: When connecting to the bastion host and the web server, do so independently of each other. The bastion host is used for interacting with AWS services via the CLI.

Solution
Log in to the AWS console using the cloud_user credentials provided. Once inside the AWS account, make sure you are using us-east-1 (N. Virginia) as the selected region.

Hint: When copying and pasting code into Vim from the lab guide, first enter :set paste (and then i to enter insert mode) to avoid adding unnecessary spaces and hashes.

Create a Trust Policy and Role Using the AWS CLI
Obtain the labreferences.txt File
Navigate to S3.

From the list of buckets, open the one that contains the text s3bucketlookupfiles in the middle of its name.

Select the labreferences.txt file.

Click Actions > Download.

Open the labreferences.txt file, as we will need to reference it throughout the lab.

Log in to Bastion Host and Set the AWS CLI Region and Output Type
Navigate to EC2 > Instances.

Copy the public IP of the Bastion Host instance.

Open a terminal, and log in to the bastion host via SSH:

ssh cloud_user@<BASTION_HOST_PUBLIC_IP>
For more information on how to connect to a Linux instance using SSH, please refer to the AWS Documentation. For more information on how to connect to a Linux instance using Putty, please refer to Connect to your Linux instance from Windows using PuTTY.

Enter the password provided for it on the lab page.

Run the following command:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws configure
Press Enter twice to leave the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key blank.

Enter us-east-1 as the default region name.

Enter json as the default output format.

Create IAM Trust Policy for an EC2 Role
Create a file called trust_policy_ec2.json:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ vim trust_policy_ec2.json
To avoid adding unnecessary spaces or hashes, type :set paste and then i to enter insert mode.

Paste in the following content:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Save and quit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq!.

Create the DEV_ROLE IAM Role
Run the following AWS CLI command:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-role --role-name DEV_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy_ec2.json
Create an IAM Policy Defining Read-Only Access Permissions to an S3 Bucket
Create a file called dev_s3_read_access.json:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ vim dev_s3_read_access.json
To avoid adding unnecessary spaces or hashes, type :set paste and then i to enter insert mode.

Enter the following content, replacing <DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME> with the bucket name provided in the labreferences.txt file:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
          "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Save and quit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq!.

Create the managed policy called DevS3ReadAccess:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-policy --policy-name DevS3ReadAccess --policy-document file://dev_s3_read_access.json
Copy the policy ARN in the output, and paste it into the labreferences.txt file — we'll need it in a minute.

Create Instance Profile and Attach Role to an EC2 Instance
Attach Managed Policy to Role
Attach the managed policy to the role, replacing <DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN> with the ARN you just copied:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DEV_ROLE --policy-arn "<DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN>"
Verify the managed policy was attached:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name DEV_ROLE
Create the Instance Profile and Add the DEV_ROLE via the AWS CLI
Create instance profile named DEV_PROFILE:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
Add role to the DEV_PROFILE called DEV_ROLE:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE --role-name DEV_ROLE
Verify the configuration:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
Attach the DEV_PROFILE Role to an Instance
In the AWS console, navigate to EC2 > Instances.

Copy the instance ID of the instance named Web Server instance and paste it into the labreferences.txt file — we'll need it in a second.

In the terminal, attach the DEV_PROFILE to an EC2 instance, replacing <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> with the Web Server instance ID you just copied:

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> --iam-instance-profile Name="DEV_PROFILE"
Verify the configuration (be sure to replace <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> with the Web Server instance ID again):

[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID>
This command's output should show this instance is using DEV_PROFILE as an IamInstanceProfile. Verify this by locating the IamInstanceProfile section in the output, and look below to make sure the "Arn" ends in /DEV_PROFILE.

Test S3 Permissions via the AWS CLI
In the AWS console, copy the public IP of the Web Server instance.

Open a new terminal.

Log in to the web server instance via SSH:

ssh cloud_user@<WEB_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
Use the same password for the bastion host provided on the lab page.

Verify the instance is assuming the DEV_ROLE role:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
We should see DEV_ROLE in the Arn.

List the buckets in the account:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls
Copy the entire name (starting with cfst) of the bucket with s3bucketdev in its name.

Attempt to view the files in the s3bucketdev- bucket, replacing <s3bucketdev-123> with the bucket name you just copied:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketdev-123>
We should see a list of files.

Create an IAM Policy and Role Using the AWS Management Console
Create Policy
In the AWS console, navigate to IAM > Policies.

Click Create policy.

Click the JSON tab.

Paste the following text as the policy, replacing <PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME> with the bucket name provided in the labreferences.txt file:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
          "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Click Next: Tags.

Click Next: Review.

Enter ProdS3ReadAccess as the policy name.

Click Create policy.

Create Role
Click Roles in the left-hand menu.

Click Create role.

Under Choose a use case, select EC2.

Click Next: Permissions.

In the Filter policies search box, enter ProdS3ReadAccess.

Click the checkbox to select ProdS3ReadAccess.

Click Next: Tags.

Click Next: Review.

Give it a Role name of PROD_ROLE.

Click Create role.

Attach IAM Role to an EC2 Instance Using the AWS Management Console
Navigate to EC2 > Instances.

Select the Web Server instance.

Click Actions > Security > Modify IAM role.

In the IAM role dropdown, select PROD_ROLE.

Click Save.

Test the Configuration
Open the existing terminal connected to the Web Server instance. (You may need to reconnect if you've been disconnected.)

Determine the identity currently being used:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
This time, we should see PROD_ROLE in the Arn.

List the buckets:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls
Copy the entire name (starting with cfst) of the bucket with s3bucketprod in its name.

Attempt to view the files in the s3bucketprod- bucket, replacing <s3bucketprod-123> with the bucket name you just copied:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketprod-123>
It should list the files.

In the aws s3 ls command output, copy the entire name (starting with cfst) of the bucket with s3bucketsecret in its name.

Attempt to view the files in the <s3bucketsecret-123> bucket, replacing <s3bucketsecret-123> with the bucket name you just copied:

[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketsecret-123>
This time, our access will be denied — which means our configuration is properly set up.
